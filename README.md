# Fullstack CI/CD Pipeline Project ðŸš€

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a fullstack application using **NestJS (Backend)** and **React (Frontend)**. It automates the entire lifecycle â€” build, test, package, and deploy â€” using **Jenkins**, with rollback support and production-ready setup on a local Ubuntu server.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: NestJS
- **CI/CD Tool**: Jenkins
- **Process Manager**: PM2
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Scripting**: Bash

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

/frontend # React frontend source
/backend # NestJS backend source
/deploy
â””â”€â”€ deploy_backend.sh # Deployment script for backend
â””â”€â”€ rollback.sh # Rollback script for backend
/Jenkinsfile # CI/CD pipeline definition


---

## ðŸš€ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

1. **Checkout** project from GitHub
2. **Install** dependencies for both frontend & backend
3. **Build** both apps
4. **Package** built apps into `.tar.gz`
5. **Deploy** backend using `deploy_backend.sh`
6. **Rollback** if deployment fails (from backup)

---

## ðŸ§ª Tests

Currently prints "No tests yet" for placeholder â€” you can extend `npm test` sections in `package.json`.

---

## ðŸ”™ Rollback Support

If deployment fails, Jenkins automatically triggers `rollback.sh` to restore the last successful backup.
